# The Allen Institute for Brain Science Uses Generative AI Tools to Unlock the Mysteries of the Human Brain

## Overview and Origin

The Allen Institute for Brain Science was founded in 2003 by Paul G. Allen and four employees with the goal of trying to understand the inner workings of the human brain along with the human immune system by mapping an entire mammalian brain. 

Paul G. Allen, being a philanthropist himself, launched the company with $100 million of his own resournces and contined to gain support from the governement like the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other private donors through open calls and invitation.

## Business Activities

The Allen Institute for Brain Science's hallmark project is the Brain Knowldge Platform (BKP), which is aimed to be the largest open-source database of brain cell data in the world. By leveraging the technology of Amazon Wed Services (AWS), the BKP will be the large data set if it's kind to compile and standaridize massive datasets of struction and function of the mamammlian brains with the hope of being able to better diagnose and treat mental and neuroligize disorders and diseases.
