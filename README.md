# The Allen Institute for Brain Science Uses Generative AI Tools to Unlock the Mysteries of the Human Brain




## Overview and Origin




[The Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/) for Brain Science was founded in 2003 by Paul G. Allen and four employees with the goal of trying to understand the inner workings of the human brain along with the human immune system by mapping an entire mammalian brain.




Paul G. Allen, being a philanthropist himself, launched the company with $100 million of his own resources and continued to gain support from the government like the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other private donors through open calls and invitation.




## Business Activities




The Allen Institute for Brain Science's hallmark project is the [Brain Knowldge Platform](https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/bkp) (BKP), which is aimed to be the largest open-source database of brain cell data in the world. By leveraging the technology of Amazon Wed Services (AWS), the BKP will host the [Allen Brain Cell](https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/bkp/abc-atlas) (ABC) Atlas which will be the first largest data set if its kind to standardize the massive datasets of structure and function of mammalian brains.

One of the biggest challenges of current research in neruoscience is the overwhelming complexity of the brain and vast amounts of data that isn't centralized or organzied in meaningful way. 


The goal of the BKP and ABC Atlas is create a comprhensive knowdledge base to better diagnose and treat mental and neurological disorders and diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease which affects millions of people worldwide. These are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases that could accelerate our understanding and treatments along with many other brain disorders.




Unlike other projects the BKP and ABC Atlas proposes invaluable and accelerated multimodal characterization of brain cell types in the the following disciplines of study:




* [Anatomy](https://portal.brain-map.org/anatomy)
* [Cell Types](https://portal.brain-map.org/cell-types)
* [Circuits & Behavior](https://portal.brain-map.org/circuits-behavior)
* [Connectivity](https://portal.brain-map.org/connectivity)
* [Computational Modeling & Theory](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/models)
* [Gene Expression](https://portal.brain-map.org/gene-expression)
* [Genetic Tools](https://portal.brain-map.org/computational-tools)


With the help of AWS and machine learning tools, vast amounts of data can be analyzed and segmented to discover new insights that aren't initially obvious. Generative AI will allow integration of other data types to bring new insights to make predictions that typically wouldn't be possible with human researchers.


## Brain Mapping with Generative AI


The BKP leverages Generative AI to map the human brain by analyzing massive datasets of brain scans to understand and identify patterns and connections between different brain regions. The ABC Atlas models brain networks and can predict brain activity based on specific stimuli to better understand neural functions to identify potential abnormalities in brain disorders.


Computational analysis tools from the Allen Institute scientists have been made public to encourage an open and collaborative community. Following are a few example of tools and used:


* [Cell Type Mapper](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/cell_type_mapper) - "A python package for mapping single cell RNA sequencing data on a cell type taxonomy"


* [mfishtools](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/mfishtools) - "Package for gene selection and analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, including MERFISH."


* [scrattch.bigcat](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/scrattch.bigcat) - "Package for clustering analysis for extremely large single cell dataset."


A comprehensive list of tools can be seen [here](https://portal.brain-map.org/computational-tools).
